START
    INPUT num
    Initialize temp as an empty list or string
    Initialize index to 0

    WHILE num != 0
        Extract the last digit of num (digit = num % 10)
        Convert digit to character (or store it as a string)
        Store it in temp at position index
        Increment index
        Remove the last digit from num (num = num / 10)

    Manipulate digits if necessary (e.g., sum digits)

    IF manipulation done
        PRINT sum of digits (or any other manipulation result)

    PRINT "Reversed Number: "

        PRINT temp[i]

Walkthrough:
Let’s assume the input is num = 1234.

Step 1: Initialize temp = "" and index = 0.
Step 2: Start extracting digits:
num = 1234, last digit is 4, temp = "4", index = 1, num = 123.
num = 123, last digit is 3, temp = "43", index = 2, num = 12.
num = 12, last digit is 2, temp = "432", index = 3, num = 1.
num = 1, last digit is 1, temp = "4321", index = 4, num = 0.
Step 3: Manipulate if necessary (e.g., sum the digits 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 10).
Step 4: Print any manipulated result (if applicable, print 10).
Step 5: Print the reversed digits:
Start printing from temp[index-1] to temp[0]: 1 2 3 4.
Output: Reversed Number: 4321.

Advantages of This Approach:
Flexibility: You can easily manipulate the digits (e.g., sum, check conditions) before printing, without storing them permanently.
Efficient Use of Temporary Storage: You’re only storing the digits temporarily, which avoids memory overhead from large arrays.
Simplicity: The algorithm is simple and avoids unnecessary complexity while still giving you flexibility when needed.
This approach is efficient and provides the flexibility you need without unnecessary storage of digits.
